# EXAM-DDMS
Digital Document Management System-(DDMS) is a system that will help schools organize their past exam papers and revision materials into a central server accessible to both the learners and the teachers/lecturers. 

Welcome to the EXAM-DDMS

****# EXAM - DIGITAL DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM****

**### Problem to be solved.**

Finding revision materials has been a problem for every learning institution, where past papers are always hardly reachable by the learners, owing to the poor archival conditions and mechanism used by the institution. For that reason, this system seeks to put an end to this as schools will now leverage its central portal to access documents that had been scanned and uploaded into the system.

### Solution

A DDMS will help distribute the needed resources to all registered users over the portal, categorizing them into institutional levels and giving access control mechanisms to every user level, online. 

**### Features**

1. Document Upload: Ability to upload scanned copies or digital files of exam question papers into the system.

2. Indexing and Categorization: Organizing the documents into categories or subjects to facilitate easy search and retrieval.

3. Search Functionality: Providing a robust search feature to allow users to find specific exam papers by keywords, subjects, dates, or other relevant 
   criteria.

4. Access Controls: Implementing role-based access controls to ensure that only authorized users can view and download the exam papers.


**### Risks:**
1. Data Security and Privacy Risks:
2. Compliance and Legal Concerns: 
3. Data Loss or Corruption:
4. Unauthorized Access: 
5. System Performance: 
6. Cost and Budget:
